Definitions
===========

Contribution 
------------
A "contribution" shall be defined as any change or addition to any part of the pyXSD package that is submitted to the pyXSD project. The "pyXSD package" includes, but is not limited to, any content in the repository and the contents of any official pyXSD release.

Contributor
-----------
A "contributor" shall be defined as anyone who submits a contribution. This definition includes those with commit access and anyone who makes a contribution through other means.

Official pyXSD Release
----------------------
A "official pyXSD release" shall be defined as any distribution of pyXSD that is distributed to the public from the pyXSD website. Any release that is not made by the pyXSD team and/or distributed from the pyXSD website shall not be considered an official release. 

Official pyXSD Team
-------------------
The "official pyXSD Team" shall be defined as all developers and administrators for the official pyXSD project. 

Offical pyXSD Project
---------------------
pyXSD was developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Facility that is operated by UT-Battelle, Inc. (SEE `origins`_), but UT Battelle decided not to retain the copyright of pyXSD. The Copyright is held by the authors, Kali Norby and Michael Summers. The "Official pyXSD Project" shall be defined as the effort to maintain and continue the development of the pyXSD software as an open source package. This project shall include some staff at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the official pyXSD team. The project's website shall be considered any content on the "pyxsd.org" domain as well as some content on other sites.

Member
------
A "member" shall be defined as any user who registers on the official pyXSD website, and is granted a username. Members shall not be considered part of the offical pyXSD project.

Developer
---------
A "developer" shall be defined as a user who has been granted commit access to the repository and given at least the title of "developer" on the pyXSD project's website. Administrator's can be developers, but are not implicitly defined as one. Normally, a developer is a member of the site who has made contributions and has established his or her self as being trusted. The developer shall be considered part of the official pyXSD team, but only administrators shall be allowed to accept contributions and make policy decisions. It shall also be the administrator's job to make official releases. Developers shall implicitly agree to this contribution policy when making contributions. The developer's status can be revoked at any time.

Administrator
-------------
An "administrator" shall be defined as a user granted with the permission to make official project policy decisions, accept contributions made by members or other sources, and make any other project change as allowed under the license. All administrator's shall have the title "administrator" on the pyXSD website.

Policy

Project Contribution Policy
---------------------------
Everyone on the pyXSD project welcomes any contribution to the project. Since pyXSD is open source, user contributions of code, documentation, or any other kind of contribution keep the project alive. We welcome anyone to submit their changes/additions; however, all the contents of any official pyXSD release must be under the pyXSD license. For this reason, we must ask that anyone submitting code to waive their copyright. The license does include protection for contributers. Users who do not make many contributions will be asked to agree to these terms every time, while users who make many contribution will be asked to agree to these terms for all contributions made (these users includes developers). An e-mail from the user acknowledging that he or she understands these terms and agrees to them is all that will be asked of any contributor. If a contribution is not accepted, the contributor will retain their copyright on the rejected submission. Any contributor who's contributions were accepted will be acknowledged in a credits page. 

Guidelines for Submission
-------------------------
SEE `get involved`_ for guidelines. In short, if you have any contributions, and you agree to the terms above, e-mail your contribution to kali.norby@gmail.com. It is recommended that you read the guidelines first.
