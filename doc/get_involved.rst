Introduction
============

Submission Guidelines
---------------------

The official development team may be limited to only a few people, but don't let that stop you from getting involved with the pyXSD project. As an open source project, any contribution is valued. If you ever see something in the code or documentation that you think could be made better, e-mail your change to kali.norby@gmail.com. Please review the `contribution policy`_ before you submit anything to me. I will ask you again if you agree to terms before the contribution will be reviewed, but it is better in general to agree before you submit. If you are planning to make a contribution greater than a few changes, please contact me first. Users who establish trust by making contributions will  be made developers.

.. _`contribution policy`: contributions-policy

Bugs
----

Please `Submit bugs through the tracker`_ or send bug reports to kali.norby@gmail.com. Please be as detailed as possible. Since bug reports alone do not make changes to the code, they will not be considered project contributions; however, they are greatly appreciated.

.. _`Submit bugs through the tracker`: https://pyxsd.org/tracker/pyXSD/newticket

Ways to Get Involved
====================

There are several different ways to get involved. If you use pyXSD, and you see some small change that could be made, please submit it! If you are reading the documentation that comes with the program or that is on the website and you see a grammatical error, please, submit it! These small changes matter a great deal. If you want to make a bigger contribution, consider some of the suggestions below.

The TODO List
-------------

Everything on the `TODO list`_ is just waiting to be done!

.. _`TODO list`: todo-rst

Documentation
-------------

If you can write documentation for the project, please do. If you are writing something that is at all long, you should probably send me a message at kali.norby@gmail.com first, in order to prevent unneeded or redundant work from being done.

Your Own Suggestion
-------------------

If you have your own idea for an add-on, e-mail me at kali.norby@gmail.com, and we can discuss it in greater detail.
