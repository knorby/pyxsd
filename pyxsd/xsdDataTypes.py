"""
This module contains classes of primitive data types found in xml xsd files.
These check of make sure that the value assigned to an element is of the proper data type.
Many correspond closely to data types in python, and others are more complex.

Every `__init__` method class, which is in every class but XsdDataType, has `val` as its only
parameter. `val` is the value assigned that is being checked. For example, in the assignment 'Integer(5)',
'Integer' is the class and '5' the value being checked.

This module contains the following classes:

- *XsdDataType*
- *Integer*
- *PositiveInteger*
- *NonNegativeInteger*
- *NegativeInteger*
- *NonPositiveInteger*
- *Double*
- *TypeList*
- *Boolean*
- *String*
- *ID*
- *IDREF*
- *Base64Binary*
