class Element(ElementRepresentative):

    The class for the element tag. Subclass of *ElementRepresentative*.
    The element tag and the attribute tag are the most important in the
    xml and in the program, so this class contains some machinery that
    many of the other classes do not have. The element and attribute
    classes contain descriptor methods. By specifing the `__get__`,
    `__set__`, and `__delete__` (with `__get__` and `__set__` being the
    most important). These methods specify how a variable is set and
    how it retrieved. Any modification of these methods should be made
    under extreme caution! Both Element and Attribute, primarily
    Attribute, use these descriptors to add a level oof checking to the
    program. If some variable is set to some value that does no match
    the specifications in the schema, an error will be raised. These
    methods add a powerful layer of functionality, with a small amount
    of code; however, these functions are almost invisible unless they
    raise an error, so developers should bear in mind these methods
    when modifying the program.
