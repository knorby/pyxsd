"""The ElementRepresentative System
================================

The ElementReprsentative system is in charge of converting the schema
file into a collection of classes that represent the types in the
schema. The system takes in the ElementTree representation of the
schema file. The pyXSD class calls ElementTree to parse the schema
file in order to keep all calls to ElementTree in one place. The
classmethod `factory` in the ElementRepresentative class starts the
system up, and it is the function that pyXSD calls.  `factory` first
reads in an ElementTree element, and then finds a class that has the
same name as the name of element's tag type. `factory` makes an
instance of the class that it finds. In these tag type classes, the
`__init__` function is the first to be called. Each of these classes
are subclasses of ElementRepresentative.  These tag specific classes'
`__init__` call the `__init__` in the ElementRepresentative class. The
`__init__` function in ElementRepresentative collects general
information about the name and make calls to specifiic functions to
help with this operation.  Some of these functions are located in
ElementReprsentative exclusively, but many can also be found in the
specific classes. For example, the getName() function normally calls a
version of the function in the ER class, but on some tags, the ER
version of getName() would not generate a unique name in every case,
or it would lack all the needed information on all or some cases. In
the classes for such tags, there is another version of getName() that
overrides the ElementRepresentative version. In general, the most
common methods are found in ElementRepresentative, while methods that
are very specific to a tag are found in the class. All the methods
needed to parse the tree are found in the *ER* class. These classes
that override must all have the same arguements in order for the
system to work. The system was designed so that it is each
ElementRepresentatives job to:
    
- Collect all information from the element and put it in the
  appropriate place
    
- Construct ElementRepresentatives for all of the element children

The `__init__` function
-----------------------

In the ER `__init__` function, it makes a call to the processChildren
method, which calls the `factory` on all of the children of an
element. Since the ER `__init__` calls this method, any variable
assignment that is needed by the children must be made before the call
to the ER __init__ function. The children are completely processed
before the parent is fully finished. Any developer should be mindful
of this fact when creating or changing an `__init__` method in a tag
type class.

Each `__init__` function has two variables as arguments:

    - `xsdElement`- the ElementTree element that is being converted to
      an ER

    - `parent`- the parent ER for the tag being processed.

Remember: the tag type classes are called from `factory` so each
`__init__` must follow this same pattern in order to work.

Class Constuction
-----------------

Currently, the classes are constucted in the *xsdType* class. This
class is the base class for *complexType* and *simpleType*. Class
constuction is currently done using a class type factory, which uses
the *type* class to build new classes by supplying a dictionary, tuple
of bases, and a name. This class is called from *pyXSD* and the
classes are stored in a dictionary in that class. This method works
well, but it would be better to use a custom metaclass to build these
classes. A metaclass would make it easier to print out the generated
classes to a file so that the programmer could use them for whatever
purpose they have, or modify a class to extend a type in the schema
without actually changing the schema. Some work has been done to make
this change, but it would be in later versions if at all.
